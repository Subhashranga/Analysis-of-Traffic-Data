# Analysis-of-Traffic-Data

The aim of this project is to analyze the traffic rate for two different packet sizes (difference in number of bytes) and check how the flow of the traffic changes from one bitrate to the other. 
This study on traffic based on packet sizes will acknowledge and ensures how the packet size does matters in order to regulate the traffic. MATLAB is used to analyse the data.
